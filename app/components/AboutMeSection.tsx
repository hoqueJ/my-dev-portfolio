        Hi, my name&apos;s Jubayedul. Thanks for taking out the time to check
        out my portfolio ðŸ˜Š! I&apos;m a Junior Frontend Web Developer, I enjoy
        building amazing websites and landing pages that are attractive,
        immersive and perform well. I am currently learning Backend development
        as well as Database Interaction on the Cloud in order to expand my
        skills.

        My goal is to become a skilled Full Stack Programmer, proficient in both
        Frontend and Backend Web Development and able to write clean, functional
        code which can be tested and quality approved with automated scripts.

          <div key={index} className="card">
